🌌 StabMasterArson Enhancement Portal

Welcome to the official Enhancement Portal — a curated hub of tools, tweaks, and ideas designed to expand and optimize your StabMasterArson experience.

Here, you’ll find creative extensions, performance boosters, UI refinements, and experimental features inspired by modular, offline-first, and privacy-respecting principles. 

🧭 What This Portal Is

This isn’t just a list of add-ons — it’s a living catalog that evolves as new improvements and experiments are released.

The portal provides:

Smart filtering by tags like AI, Performance, UX, HUD, and more

Offline access via intelligent caching

Dynamic enhancement loading — the portal scans all /docs/enhancements/*.json files automatically

Color-coded categories for fast visual scanning

Mobile-friendly UI that works even in flight mode

⚙️ How to Use the Portal
1️⃣ Browse Enhancements

All available enhancements are displayed in an interactive grid.
You can explore by:

Category — AI Tools, Optimization Modules, UI Enhancements, etc.

Tags — click any tag chip to filter related entries instantly.

Search Bar — type part of a name or keyword to find matching enhancements.

Each enhancement card includes:

Name and short description

Tags for classification

External link for more details, documentation, or optional downloads

2️⃣ Filter by Tag or Category

Use the sidebar to:

Toggle categories like AI Tools, Performance, Rendering, HUD Tweaks, etc.

Apply multiple filters at once.

Quickly clear filters to reset the list.

Tag colors help you recognize enhancement types:

🟦 AI-related → Cyan

🟧 UI/UX → Orange

🟩 Performance/Optimization → Green

🟪 Audio/Creative → Purple

⚪ Miscellaneous → Gray

3️⃣ Offline Mode

This portal includes built-in offline caching.
Once you’ve opened the site once, it remembers your last-loaded enhancements.

✅ Offline Mode ON (green indicator): You’re using cached data

❌ Offline Mode OFF (red indicator): Live JSON fetch is active

You can toggle this feature in Settings → Offline Cache.
Perfect for traveling or when working on air-gapped systems.

4️⃣ Adjust Appearance

Open the Settings ⚙️ modal to:

Toggle between Light 🌞 and Dark 🌒 themes

Enable/disable offline caching

Reset saved preferences

All preferences are saved locally via browser storage — no cloud sync or tracking.

📁 Enhancement JSONs

All enhancement data is stored in public JSON files under:

/docs/enhancements/


Examples:

/docs/enhancements/ai-tools.json

/docs/enhancements/hud-tweaks.json

/docs/enhancements/performance.json

Each JSON defines a list of enhancement entries with fields like:

[
  {
    "name": "Adaptive HUD Mapper",
    "description": "Procedural HUD that adjusts display intensity in real-time.",
    "tags": ["AI", "HUD", "UX"],
    "url": "https://example.com/hud-mapper"
  }
]


New enhancements appear automatically the next time you open the site — no reload or code change required.

🪶 About the Project

The StabMasterArson Enhancement Portal was created to make experimentation effortless and organized.

Core Principles:

Offline-first design — usable without an internet connection

Privacy-respecting — no analytics, cookies, or tracking

Modular architecture — every feature can evolve independently

Performance-optimized — fast loading, small footprint

Transparent updates — all changes recorded in manifest and history files

🧩 Enhancement Categories
Category	Description
AI Tools	Machine-learning-based generation and optimization helpers
HUD & UI Tweaks	Visual, accessibility, and usability upgrades
Performance	GPU/CPU optimizations and real-time tuning modules
Procedural Assets	Systems that dynamically create content on the fly
Creative Utilities	Artistic tools, effects, and customization systems
Offline AI	Local learning and inference tools without cloud reliance
🔄 Updates & Versioning

Each rebuild of the enhancement catalog creates a new manifest version.

You can view the update history here:
📘 /docs/manifest-history.md

Version tags (e.g. manifest-v2025.10.04) record when new or updated enhancements were published.

🧭 Tips for Advanced Users

Use browser bookmarks to quickly open filtered views like
...?tag=AI or ...?category=HUD

Enable Offline Mode for air-gapped systems
